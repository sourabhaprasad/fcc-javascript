# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta)

All the projects were created as part of my journey in learning JavaScript and implementing hands-on skills in primarily JavaScript along with HTML and CSS.

# Projects

This curriculum helped me master fundamental JavaScript concepts like variables, arrays, and functions, while also delving into advanced topics such as Object Oriented and Functional Programming.
I developed problem-solving skills through algorithmic thinking and learned practical techniques like working with local storage and fetching data from APIs.
This certification equipped me with a robust skill set essential for building dynamic and responsive web applications.
